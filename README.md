# A_Star_Algorithm
In this project I used the Java programming language to code the A Star pathfinding algorithm. I used multiple different objects and helper methods to help me write this algorithm. The algorithm was implemented using the basic stacks and queues in the java.util repository. As opposed to the regular dijkstra's algorithm the A Star Algorithm uses a function that makes it more efficient in that it doesn't search every possible path, rather it decides based on distance if it is a valid path. 

In the test class I provided, 1s represent valid nodes that can be traversed, whereas 0s represent obstacles that the algorithm will have to find a path around.
